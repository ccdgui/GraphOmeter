# GraphOmeter
## Graph modeling and representation of patient interactions on a health forum. 

### Overview 

GraphOmeter is a network study and visualization project to analyze interactions between users inside a Health Forum about migraine (message board). Participation inequality is a well known concept in social media media and online communities : user participation is often concentrated among few very active participants (the "90 - 9 - 1 rule"). The purpose of GraphOmeter is to indentify the active participants and analyse how they are distributed and connected inside a Graph. 

### Output 
Graph representation of a health forum using Matplotlib. Each node represents a user, each edge represents a message posted to another user.
